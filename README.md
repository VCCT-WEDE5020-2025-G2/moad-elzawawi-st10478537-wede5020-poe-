Website Structure and Planning
How I Organized Everything: I drew this out on paper first, thinking about how someone would actually move through the site.
Home Page → Learn About Us → See Our Programs → Get Involved (Volunteer or Donate)
That's the main flow, but I also made sure every page connects logically to every other page.
File Structure I Built:
/cape-hope-foundation/
├── index.html (home page)
├── about.html (our story)
├── programmes.html (what we do)
├── enquiry.html (get involved)  
├── contact.html (donate & contact)
├── /css (styles for Part 2)
├── /js (functionality for Part 3)
└── /images (all photos organized by section)
I spent time getting this organization right because I knew it would save me headaches later.
HTML Structure Implementation
Building the Foundation: I started each page with proper HTML5 structure - header, nav, main content, and footer. I made sure every image has alt text and every form has proper labels. These details matter for accessibility and SEO.
Navigation System: The menu stays the same on every page, and I highlight which page you're currently on. Simple, but it helps people never feel lost.
Code Quality: I commented everything thoroughly because I know I'll forget why I made certain decisions. I also kept the code clean and properly indented - it's just good practice.
One thing I'm proud of is that every page validates properly. It's tempting to cut corners, but doing it right from the start prevents problems later.
File and Folder Organisation
Staying Organized: I learned from past projects that good organization at the beginning saves tons of time later. Every image has a descriptive name, every file goes in the right folder, and I set up version control from day one.
My System:
•	HTML files named clearly (about.html, not page2.html)
•	Images sorted by where they're used (hero images, program photos, team pictures)
•	Consistent naming so anyone could understand the structure
I also started a README file right away to document my decisions and keep track of what still needs to be done.
