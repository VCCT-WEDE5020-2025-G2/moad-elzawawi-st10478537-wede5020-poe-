                        <h3>Our Story</h3>
                        <p>Cape Hope Foundation was established in 2015 by a group of passionate educators and community leaders who recognized the urgent need for comprehensive support for underprivileged children in Cape Town's townships.</p>
                        
                        <p>What started as a small feeding scheme at a single primary school has grown into a comprehensive support network spanning 15 schools across Cape Town, directly impacting thousands of children and their families.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our journey began when founder Sarah Mitchell, a former teacher, witnessed firsthand how hunger and lack of educational resources prevented talented children from reaching their potential. Together with local community leaders, she established Cape Hope Foundation with a simple but powerful vision: every child deserves the opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive.</p>
